# Benchmarking for Demand Forecasting in Supply Chain Management

**Tagline:**  
A standardized framework to benchmark and compare state-of-the-art demand-forecasting models on real-world demand data.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

Many existing time-series benchmarks rely on tasks (e.g., stock-price prediction) that are only tangentially related to supply-chain needs. **Benchmarking for Demand Forecasting in Supply Chain Management** fills this gap by providing:

- **Real-world datasets** 
- **A unified evaluation pipeline** 
- **Out-of-the-box metrics** 

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python â‰¥ 3.11  
- `pip`  

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:  
2. Install the requirements:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuring

All pipeline settings live in config/. Youâ€™ll find:
config/config.example.yaml â€” a template for your own config/config.yaml
**DO NOT commit** your own config/config.yaml; itâ€™s ignored by .gitignore

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage
Once you have your config.yaml set up, you can run the pipeline with:
```bash
python -m src.main -c config/config.yaml

```
You can also test the example pipeline with:
```bash
python -m src.main -c config/config.example.yaml
```
